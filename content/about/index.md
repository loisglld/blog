Hello there üê≥  
{{< /typeit >}}

**Totally into new tech**, I‚Äôm a _21-year-old French engineering student_ who spends every free moment exploring the coolest tech fields. My curiosity takes me everywhere, especially into **cloud computing** and awesome tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, and all their buddies. I can totally see myself growing in these areas as I move forward in my career.

After being employed as a part-time DevOps assistant alongside my engineering studies, I'm currently part of the **Cloud Program at AXA France** based in **La D√©fense** ‚Äî the heart of the French business district. There, I contribute to infrastructure product development within the **OPS Guild** in the **PaaS** team, working hands-on with **Terraform** and **Microsoft Azure**.

Outside of my professional role, I like to experiment with **full-stack development**, explore new technologies, and refine my understanding of both the front-end and the back-end. I‚Äôm especially drawn to _the reliability and scalability challenges of cloud-native systems_.

This blog is where I document the things I learn, the tools I use, and the concepts _I find worth sharing_. It‚Äôs not meant to be flashy ‚Äî just a space to reflect, structure my thoughts, and hopefully provide something useful along the way.
