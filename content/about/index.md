Hello there 🐳  
{{< /typeit >}}

**Totally into new tech**, I’m a _21-year-old French engineering student_ who spends <ins>every free moment</ins> diving into new programming languages and exploring the coolest tech fields. My curiosity takes me everywhere, especially into **cloud computing** and awesome tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, and all their buddies. I can totally see myself growing in these areas as I move forward in my career.

_Currently, I'm working part-time for a German company, which allows me to practice my AWS skills and gain valuable professional experience._ On the side, I develop full-stack projects, giving me the chance to master both front-end and back-end development.

To keep track of all the _cool stuff_ I’m learning and to share my journey, I decided to start a blog. It’s way better than letting my notes disappear into a Notion page or get lost in a pile of paper. This blog is my way of contributing to the community while structuring my own learning journey.

> **So, don't wait any longer** _head over to the blog and dive into the articles nowww 💨_
